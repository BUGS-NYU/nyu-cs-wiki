# Chipotle

Manhattan:

- [117 E 14th St, New York, NY 10003](https://goo.gl/maps/UnfyJcnXAQdkUf3e8): Close to Palladium and the quality is pretty good.
- [405 6th Ave, New York, NY 10014](https://goo.gl/maps/o2faauS8GQhCdoTRA): Close to GCASL and the quality is decent. However, this store is about $1 more expensive than the one near Tandon (generally more expensive in Manhattan). 
- [55 E 8th St Frnt 2, New York, NY 10003](https://goo.gl/maps/BSodEfvxoBc4eMwQ8): Also close to GCASL but the quality is consistently bad. Avoid this location if you can!
- [625 Broadway, New York, NY 10012](https://goo.gl/maps/rBDUcLLf9c2L9H6t6): Close to the Broadway-Lafayette train station and the quality is good.

Brooklyn:

- [1 MetroTech Center, Brooklyn, NY 11201](https://goo.gl/maps/Zhq3mnZryHnAY9g87): Close to Tandon so very conveninent but it can also get crowded since everyone likes to go there during their lunch break. I would recommend trying to avoid between 12pm - 2pm. 
- [474 Fulton St, Brooklyn, NY 11201](https://goo.gl/maps/jXwYPkGQEQn9rATt9): Close to Dekalb; it's decent but you should probably go to Dekalb.

Bonus: 

- [345 Adams St, Brooklyn, NY 11201](https://goo.gl/maps/2qfGeAQkCpRbv8kFA): Cava - good Mediterranean alternative to Chipotle; more expensive but more filling.
