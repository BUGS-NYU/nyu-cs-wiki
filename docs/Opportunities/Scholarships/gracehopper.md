Who is Grace Hopper and why is she so important?
Grace Brewster Hopper, an American computer scientist, played a pivotal role in the early days of computer programming. As one of the initial programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer, she not only pioneered the field but also invented one of the earliest linkers. Hopper's groundbreaking work included formulating the concept of machine-independent programming languages. She put this theory into practice by developing the FLOW-MATIC programming language, which served as the foundation for COBOL, an enduring high-level programming language that remains in use to this day.

Fun fact: She was born in New York City, the city where NYU also resides.

Now that you know who Grace Hopper is, let's talk about the celebration now.
The Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing (GHC) is a conference series dedicated to elevating the research and professional pursuits of women in the field of computing. GHC stands as the world's largest gathering of women and non-binary individuals in technology. This annual event, named in honor of computer scientist Grace Hopper, is orchestrated by the Anita Borg Institute for Women and Technology.

The duration of the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing (GHC) can vary from year to year, but it typically spans several days. The conference often lasts anywhere from three to five days, during which participants have the opportunity to attend a wide range of sessions, workshops, presentations, and networking events. This extended duration allows attendees to fully engage with the diverse content and activities offered at the conference and make the most of their experience.

Overall, GHC is a holistic experience that combines professional development, networking, and celebration, making it a must-attend event for those in the tech industry who are passionate about diversity and inclusion.

Who is Anita Borg?
Anita Borg (January 17, 1949 â€“ April 6, 2003) was a pioneering American computer scientist known for her tireless advocacy for women's representation and career advancement in the technology industry. She co-founded the Institute for Women and Technology and played a pivotal role in establishing the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing.

A brief history of Grace Hopper Celebration:
In 1994, Anita Borg and Telle Whitney co-founded the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing. Starting with a blank sheet of paper and a shared vision to create a conference by and for women computer scientists, Borg and Whitney embarked on this endeavor over dinner. The inaugural Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing took place in Washington, D.C., in June 1994, uniting 500 technical women in a groundbreaking event.

So now for the stuff that you were waiting for, the scholarship. Even though GHC is a really good opportunity for students to attend, it can be really costly. The passes are categorized as being either in-person or virtual. Further, there is a subcategorization of being for academics or general. Please take a look at the following table for the pricing of 2023:

| In Person General | In Person Academic | Virtual General | Virtual Academic |
| :---------------: | :----------------: | :-------------: | :--------------: |
|       $1298       |        $649        |       $649      |       $199       |

Being students, you can book either of the academic passes, but they are still very expensive. The Office of Student Leadership & Engagement NYU Tandon provides an excellent opportunity for students to be funded and to attend this conference. The scholarship will pay for the registration, the flights, as well as the stay for the duration of the conference. The applications usually go live in mid-May, and are announced by an email from the Tandon OSLE office email address (engineering@nyu.edu).

So keep an eye out for the same. Some of the questions that are a part of the application are:
1. The CS and Math classes you have taken so far, and the grade attained in them.
2. A personal statement
3. Your cumulative GPA

This is a great opportunity for students to attend this amazing conference and make use of the networking opportunities as well as the on-site interviews that happen there.
