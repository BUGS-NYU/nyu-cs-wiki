Often when directly discretizing PDEs, the resulting linear systems are sparse and efficient methods for applying the discretized operators are straightforward, and relatively efficient methods for computing their inverse has been developed. However, linear systems arising from the discretization of integral formulations of the very same PDEs are dense, and somewhat more sophisticated algorithms must be developed in order to apply and invert there operators with near optimal computational complexity. Often these algorithms are based on the underlying physics of the problem, and are therefore commonly referred to as analysis-based fast algorithms.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://cims.nyu.edu/ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ai @ NYU</a>: We are in the middle of an Artificial Intelligence revolution.
