How does a service like Shazam match a sound clip to a library of 10 million songs in under a second? How do scientists find patterns in terabytes of genetic data? How can we efficiently train neural networks with billions of parameters on terabytes of data? We will address these questions and others by studying advanced algorithmic techniques like randomization, approximation, sketching, continuous optimization, spectral methods, and Fourier methods. I really enjoyed the applied mathematics and proofs in a machine learning context. However, be forewarned that this is a very difficult Tandon course; you should have few to no difficult other classes in the same semester. Intro to Offensive Security (CS-UY 3943) Course Description: The purpose of this course is to teach the offensive side of cybersecurity, namely attacks. We will learn about and implement attacks for vulnerabilities in web applications and C/C++ binary programs (including bypasses for common exploit mitigations), learn how to reverse engineer assembly code, and break flawed cryptographic implementations. Comment: This class is a great introductory to Offensive Security Tools and methods in use by penetration testers and hackers in today's world. This is done through the use of Jeopardy Style Capture-The-Flag competition where 100% of the grade is evaluated on the effectiveness of student's system breaches. Prerequisites: None* Some experience in python scripting is expected. Please DO NOT take this class unless you have taken/are familiar with the concepts taught in Computer Architecture/Computer Systems Organization and Operating Systems.

Also, note that the experience you have can tailor you to specific roles. While some companies match you with teams after applying to a general &quot;software engineering intern&quot; position, you should try to build up projects/research in areas that you would like to focus on, whether that be web development (frontend/backend), embedded development, machine learning (many subfields here), DevOps, or something else.

However, linear systems arising from the discretization of integral formulations of the very same PDEs are dense, and somewhat more sophisticated algorithms must be developed in order to apply and invert there operators with near optimal computational complexity. Often these algorithms are based on the underlying physics of the problem, and are therefore commonly referred to as analysis-based fast algorithms. ai @ NYU: We are in the middle of an Artificial Intelligence revolution.
